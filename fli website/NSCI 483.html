							<p><b>Interview Summary</b></p>
                            <p><i>GL has consented to the publication of this report.</i></p>
                            <p>To start, I asked GL to describe when she suspected something was wrong, and how she received a diagnosis of ADHD. As a child, GL never thought that she had ADHD because she was high functioning: she had good grades in school and no behavioural issues, and she did not struggle with friendships and relationships. She began to struggle when she entered university in 2019, as she could not pay attention, focus, or motivate herself to study. She would only study for exams until the deadline was a couple hours or days away; it was only once stress (or “high-strung excitement from a random niche interest”) kicked in that she could begin to do work. GL described an “all-or-nothing” response, in which she could only work when she was hyperfixated on the topic. In her social life, her interactions suffered; as she spoke to others, she was easily distracted and could not focus on the person in front of her. In retrospect, GL had always experienced these symptoms; but they were unmanageable in 2020, especially as the university shifted format to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions. She did not realize that her experiences could be symptoms of ADHD until one of her close friends was diagnosed with ADHD in her second year. As he recounted his symptoms, GL felt like she related deeply. Because one anecdote wasn’t enough, GL did her own research and looked for others’ stories. With more questions, she looked for a physician who could help her find answers. </p>
                            <p>The process was not as straightforward as she had hoped. During the pandemic, doctors were overburdened by more urgent concerns. GL agreed that naturally, someone with a heart attack should be prioritized over someone with non-emergent ADHD… but at the same time, her needs were being delayed, and her mental health was placed on the backburner as her grades and energy suffered. In third year, her friends advised her that university doctors were more accessible. The waitlist for a psychiatrist was 2 months, rather than 6 months (with a referral from her regular family doctor) … which was not optimal, but workable. While waiting to see the psychiatrist, GL spoke to her family physician, who had a background in children with ADHD. He spoke with GL about her symptoms and screened for other conditions, such as depression or anxiety. GL felt lucky to have a family doctor with an ADHD background, as he felt comfortable prescribing her with medication to use in the interim (but GL noted this does not usually happen). GL met with the university psychiatrist for a 1–2-hour appointment, in which GL was asked to produce prior report cards, teacher’s comments, and statements from loved ones about her symptoms. Through extensive discussion, the psychiatrist ruled out other psychiatric challenges, before diagnosing GL with ADHD. </p>
                            <p>I asked GL to reflect on the process of receiving a diagnosis. Many of her barriers to accessing healthcare were natural consequences of the pandemic, but GL also mentioned barriers due to stereotypes associated with ADHD. When we imagine someone with ADHD, we imagine a hyperactive child “bouncing off the walls”, who is unable to sit still school. However, GL’s ADHD corresponds more with the “attention-deficit” part of ADHD, in which she lacked focus and motivation. Furthermore, GL did well in school and seemed fine; therefore, her symptoms were “masked”. Because she was not the stereotypical picture of ADHD, no one in her life – not even GL herself – detected the disorder until adulthood. </p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Since her diagnosis, GL has been using stimulant medication to manage her symptoms. She has found the treatment to be effective, observing large improvements in her academic and social life. For one, GL feels like she is “actually learning”, because getting everyday tasks done (like booking an appointment or following through on plans) no longer feels so burdensome. She has more executive control, allowing her to decide when and how to study. In addition to medication, GL also consulted an academic counsellor, but she felt that she did not need this. She already knew about the study strategies the counsellor recommended – the hard part was to actually apply them, which the medication helped her to do. </p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, GL mentioned difficulties with the stimulants. Initially, she was so excited by the ability to focus that she went “too hard” with her studies, leading to burnout – but she has since learned to prioritize work-life balance. There are also side effects. She must take it at the right time, or else she would be unable to sleep at night. Since her medication suppresses appetite, she has struggled with eating enough food to get through the day. She has a nagging concern for her cardiovascular health, as the medication increases heart rate and blood pressure. </p>
                            <p>GL has used academic accommodations: her school has offered extra time for tests and assignments, as well as separate rooms for completing exams. She has found them to be helpful, as she found writing an exam in a room with 600 other students to be incredibly distracting. Extra time helps GL complete her assignments with more diligence, and her grades have improved with these changes. If she could propose another accommodation, it would be to reintroduce paper exams, as she struggles to focus with computer tests. Her university has been generally accommodating, but GL experienced significant difficulties when she sought accommodations for the MCAT (Medical Colleges Admissions Test). Despite having two diagnoses from two physicians, she reported that the AAMC (the administering body for the MCAT) required applicants to undergo a $5000 psychiatric evaluation that was “ridiculously niche and specialized”. Since the MCAT is such an important test, of course some students would want to gain an advantage by inappropriately using accommodations; but the cost and effort for one’s diagnosis to be validated by the AAMC poses huge barriers to students who need it the most. Consequently, GL wrote the MCAT without accommodations and found her test conditions to be extremely distracting. Really, a quiet, separate room should not have costed $5000 to obtain. </p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Next, I asked GL about her experiences with stigma and misconceptions of ADHD. Many people have made off-hand, dismissive comments about her ADHD: for example, making jokes about being so “ADHD” to describe someone being a little more energetic than normal, or remarking that “everyone has ADHD these days”. As someone with “high-functioning” ADHD, GL faced pushback from her parents, who did not believe she had ADHD but eventually supported her decision to consult a doctor. When she started treatment, GL’s parents attributed any moodiness or irritability as the fault of her medications, which frustrated GL for their inability to understand her disorder. But nowadays, GL feels very supported: her family and friends do not care that she has ADHD, only that she is doing well. She is grateful for this; but the final source of stigma comes from herself, in which GL wondered (and still wonders) if she had “made up” her diagnosis, if she had confused it with burnout, or if she had somehow “gaslit” her doctors and families to support her ADHD as an unconscious bid to seek attention or to seem “special”. </p>
                            <p>I asked her a question about if ADHD has grown in incidence not because of natural causes, but because of a modern environment, in which people are overstimulated by work and technology. She noted that environment is implicated in the development of any disease, and that many emerging fields (like epigenetics) are dedicated to unraveling the influence of nature vs. nurture. But even if her ADHD is artificially produced, she must find a way to live within this environment and to seek help for her dysfunction. GL made an analogy to a cancer patient who lives near a nuclear reactor: the unnatural environment was the cause, but the cancer is very much real. Treatment should involve medication, but also moving away from the reactor; similarly, ADHD treatment should involve medication and cognitive strategies to improve executive function. </p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>To conclude, I asked GL what she hoped to see in the future, as well as any insight not covered by my previous questions. She advocated for people to have a better understanding of ADHD, in which small things (like requests to slow down in conversations) are gently respected. It’s a hard problem to solve, but more physicians with ADHD expertise would streamline the process of diagnosis. She is not too familiar with ADHD research but hopes for continued work to understand the etiology, as well as treatments that have less side effects. </p>
                            <p>As for special insight, she mentioned that, although her ADHD causes problems in her life, it does have its perks. She mentioned sometimes achieving a ‘golden zone’ for stress, where she feels mentally clear and finishes things extremely quickly. On the medications, her head is an echo chamber; but off, her head is a series of trains crashing one after another – which isn’t pleasant, but the cool thing is that she can jump between trains of thought extremely quickly and figure out different paths. When I brought up a theory that the distractibility of ADHD might have had evolutionary advantages in a primitive society, she mentioned her ability to quickly pick up small details in her surroundings, leading people to think that she had excellent memory. But in reality, she feels an inability to prioritize; everything is a priority, so even insignificant things are noticed. </p>
